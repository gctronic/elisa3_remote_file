# Elisa-3 remote file
This application shows how to control the robots based on commands read from a file, in particular the content of the packets to be transmitted is parsed from a csv file and the interpreted commands are sent to the robots one time (one command for each row).<br/>
The project depends on the [Elisa-3 remote library](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/Elisa-3#Elisa-3_library).<br/>
For more information refer to the wiki [Elisa-3 Set robots state from file](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=Elisa-3#Set_robots_state_from_file).
